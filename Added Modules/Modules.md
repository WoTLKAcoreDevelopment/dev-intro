# Modules Section of the Project
In AzerothCore, modules are a way to extend and customize the functionality of the game server without modifying the core codebase. Here's an explanation of what modules do in AzerothCore:

- Extensibility: Modules allow developers to add new features, content, or modifications to the game server without altering the main codebase.
- Modularity: Each module is self-contained, making it easier to manage, update, or remove specific features without affecting other parts of the server.
- Custom Content: Modules can add new quests, items, NPCs, commands, or game mechanics that aren't part of the standard World of Warcraft experience.
- Server Customization: They allow server administrators to tailor their server's features and content to their specific community or gameplay vision.
- Easy Integration: AzerothCore's module system provides hooks and APIs that allow modules to interact with core server functions seamlessly.
- Community Contributions: The module system encourages the community to create and share their own server modifications, enhancing the overall ecosystem.
- Maintenance: Updates to the core can be made without necessarily breaking custom content implemented through modules.
- Performance Optimization: Modules can be enabled or disabled as needed, potentially improving server performance by running only necessary features.
- Scripting: Many modules use scripts to define behavior for NPCs, quests, or events, allowing for complex custom content creation.
- Configuration: Modules often come with their own configuration files, allowing server administrators to fine-tune their behavior without coding knowledge.
